# USACO
USA Computing Olympiad Traning Problems solutions

Shortly about the purpose of this repo:

1. To train my algorithmical thinking & problem solution skills
2. To boost my knowledge of algorithms and data structures
3. To boost my git knowledge

Here is the link to the page where problem submission rules are stated: ["USACO training: submitting solutions"](http://train.usaco.org/usacotext2?a=teBpZvS26PT&S=grade)

Briefly for c++: use files "problem_name.in" & "problem_name.out" for input and output respectively. Have a comment with your ID (komron11), LANG(c++) and PROBLEM NAME at the beginning of the file, and `return 0;` in the end of the `main()` function is required.

# About chapters in USACO

Great rule in USACO: One can not switch to solving the problems of next section until all problems of current section are solved.

In this repo all commits related to any task lets say task "example",  must start with `[example]` prefix: `[example] bla bla bla`

Every branch realated to task must be named same as the task.

## Chapter 1. Basic challenges
1. Ad hoc problems
2. Complete search
3. Greedy Algorithm
4. Search Techniques
5. Binary numbers & operations
